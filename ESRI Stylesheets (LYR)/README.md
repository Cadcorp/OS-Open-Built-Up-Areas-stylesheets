# OS Open Built Up Areas

These are LYR files for OS Open Built Up Areas in **Geopackage format** for use in **ESRI ArcMap**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Built-Up-Areas-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  In ArcMap, right-click on ‘Layers’ at the top of the Table Of Contents Panel, select Properties… > then under the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid (Projected Coordinate Systems, National Grids, Europe).

**3.**  In the labeling dropdown, make sure 'Use Maplex Label Engine' is on.

**4.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format (geopackage) and stylesheet format (ESRI ArcMap stylesheets LYR)

**5.**  Select the lyr file and click ‘Add’

**6.**  Double-click on a layer to access the Layer ‘Properties’ window > select the ‘Source’> click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS Open Built Up Areas > select relevant dataset > select ‘Add’.

Repeat step 6 for all if they don't link automatically.

We recommend viewing of the data between **1:2,500** and **1:250,000** for maximum legibility.

We recommend viewing the data with OS OpenMap Local in the backdrop style or the light style of the OS Maps API.


Your map should now look similar to this:
