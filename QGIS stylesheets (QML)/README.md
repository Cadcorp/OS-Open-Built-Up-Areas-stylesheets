# OS Open Built Up Areas

These are **QML** files for OS Open Built Up Areas in **Geopackage format** for use in **QGIS**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Built-Up-Areas-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**3.**  Open QGIS.

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Vector Layer’ button and navigate to your geopackage data.

**4.**  Select the data and click ‘OK’.

**5.**  Double-click on each layer in turn to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the matching QML file to the layer you are adding the style to > click 'Open' > click 'OK'


We recommend viewing of the map between **1:2,500** and **1:250,000** for maximum legibility.

We recommend viewing the data with OS OpenMap Local in Backdrop style or the light style of the OS Maps API.



Your map should now look similar to this:

## Compatibility notes

We strive to make our QML files compatible with the latest long-term release of QGIS
