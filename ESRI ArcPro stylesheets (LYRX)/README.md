# OS Open Built Up Areas

These are lyrx files for OS Open Built Up Areas in Geopackage format for use in ESRI ArcPro.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Built-Up-Areas-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  In ArcPro, right-click on ‘Map’ towards the top of the Contents panel, select Properties… > then under Coordinate System > choose British National Grid (Projected Coordinate SYstem, National Grids, Europe). You may need to reposition to the data extent

**3.**  In the top toolbar of ArcPro, under Labeling, click 'More' and ensure the 'Use Maplex Label Engine' is ticked on.

**4.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format (geopackage) and stylesheet format (ESRI ArcPro stylesheets LYRX)

**5.**  Select the lyrx file and click ‘Add’

**6.**  In the Contents panel in ArcPro, double-click on a layer to access the Layer Properties window > select the ‘Source’> click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS Open Built Up Areas geopackage data > select relevant dataset > select ‘Add’. For example, for the OS Open Built Up Areas layer, you'd select main.OS_Open_Built_Up_Areas layer.

Repeat step 6 for all other layers if they don't link automatically.

We recommend viewing of the data between **1:2,500** and **1:250,000** for maximum legibility.

We recommend viewing the data with OS OpenMap Local in the backdrop style or the light style of the OS Maps API.


Your map should now look similar to this:
